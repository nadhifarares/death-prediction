# Reducing Patient Mortality at RS Rares

This project is focused on the goal of decreasing the number of patient deaths at RS Rares, a medical institution. The primary objective of this project is to develop strategies and interventions that will lead to a reduction in patient mortality over the upcoming one-year period.

## Problem Statement

RS Rares aims to address the critical issue of patient mortality within its facility. Reducing patient deaths is a top priority for the hospital, as it not only improves the quality of care provided but also reflects positively on the hospital's reputation. The challenge is to identify ways to minimize patient mortality through appropriate medical interventions and treatment plans.

## Objective

The core objective of this project is to proactively reduce the number of patient deaths at RS Rares. By implementing effective treatment protocols and providing appropriate care, the hospital aims to improve patient outcomes and overall survival rates. The focus is on ensuring that each patient receives timely and appropriate medical attention to prevent avoidable deaths.

## Objective as an Analyst

As a data analyst working on this project, your objective is to predict the likelihood of patient mortality based on the available data. To achieve this, you will implement two classification techniques: Random Forest and AdaBoost. These algorithms will be used to build a predictive model that can assess the probability of patient mortality. By analyzing patient data, medical history, and other relevant information, the model will help medical professionals make informed decisions about patient care and prioritize those at higher risk.

## Project Scope and Approach

To achieve the objectives of this project, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant patient data, medical records, treatment histories, and other factors that may contribute to patient mortality.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. Handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features that capture critical patient information, medical conditions, and treatment details.

4. **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, such as Random Forest and AdaBoost.

5. **Model Training:** Train the selected models using historical patient data, with the target variable being patient mortality.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using appropriate performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. **Deployment and Implementation:** Deploy the final predictive model to assist medical professionals in identifying patients at higher risk of mortality.
